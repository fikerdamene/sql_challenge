SQL CHALLENGE

Data modelling 

Data modeling is done by using QuickDBD, a quick and intuitive tool for designing and visualizing database schemas. 

-Tables are defined by specifying their names and columns along with their data types, constraints, and relationships.

-Primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes are added as needed.

-As my schemas are designed, a visual representation of my database structure is generated by QuickDBD automatically. 

-The layout of tables and relationships is rearranged and customized to enhance readability.

-Reviewed my schema design for accuracy and completeness. Made any necessary refinements to ensure my database model aligns with my requirements.


Data Engineering

•	The SQL Query is prepared manually to create each of the tables within the Database by using my ERD with the idea to practice and gain some additional experience of writing SQL queries.

•	Created each of the six tables, providing all column names, Data types, Primary Keys and referencing any required Foreign Keys and indexes within the tables.

•	With the tables created, the built-in pgAdmin 4 is used to import each of the CSV files into the created tables.
